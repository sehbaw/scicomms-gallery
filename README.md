I have developed such a love for science communications over the last couple of months especially after witnessing the Earth as Art exhibit by NASA in person during my time at the Library of Congress. 


Starting off with six charts just to get it populated and hopefully will continue to do so with charts I make! 

I want to try my best to integrate holoviews graphs as well but it is not so easy so may try Panel!
